MATH1001	Dr James Renshaw	The exam was perhaps a bit too easy and too similar to previous years. As a result there were too many marks of 80%+.	During week 4 there was a definite reaction by some of the class to me going too fast. As a result I stopped using the pre-prepared slides and used the blackboard instead. This was slower and as a result the slides and tutorials started to get out of sync'. In hindsight I feel I ended up focussing too much on the weaker students (of which there are more than normal) at the expense of the more able student.	34%		Feedback will be included on the blackboard page for the module and the students will be informed of this by email within one week of the relevant exam board.

Alter the weekly tutorial sheets so that more questions are marked each week but fewer (compulsory) questions are given out.    Next year I will move the early cipher type questions to the web (using the cipher challenge machinery) and aim to do slightly more theory at the end.

MATH1004	Dr Ruben Sanchez Garcia, Dr Jamie Foster	Most students submitted coursework regularly and obtained good marks (average 62). The class test results were also good.     The exam results are generally good (average 54), although there was a peak of students at the lower end of the scale (less than 30 marks). As the exam questions are very standard (virtually all the same to similar exercises seen in class and in coursework) this may correspond to under-prepared and/or students not engaging well with the course (see remarks on attendance below).    Some students complaint about pre-requisites, in both directions	Only 37.7% responded to the questionnaire, despite three email reminders. Most students who did the questionnaire found the course well-organised, the material well-explained with good quality notes and plenty of opportunities for questions. The tutorials were highly valued, in particular the opportunities for individual help. Both lectures scored high, and the module overall mark was above 4. 	20%	Only about half of the registered students came to lectures, and about a third to a quarter to the tutorials.	We sent an email to all the students via Blackboard (email available on request).	The course was very similar to the one last year. 	"The lecture notes need some updating. They can be streamlined, and more examples of different degree of difficulty can be included. The delivery of the material could be faster in some sections, and should be slower in parts were students struggled most.     Coursework should include a marking scheme.    The exam could be shorter, as some students seem not able to finish within 2 hours.     The grand challenge is to make the course more interesting and engaging, so that more students come to lectures and tutorials, while dealing with a vast difference of mathematical background. Perhaps organising the material (lecture notes, coursework etc) into ""essential"", ""desirable"", etc."	Module lead	Save and Submit	2086425	Dr Ruben Sanchez Garcia	1394539746	80	10	10	no	no	yes	yes	yes	yes
MATH1006	Prof Nils Andersson	Average and marks distribution fine without any scaling or particular tweaking.    The exam seems to have gone well overall. There was an unfortunate typo in the exam paper where a partial fraction required complex roots. In theory the students should have been able to deal with that, but I appreciate that it took the solution a little further than intended. To ensure that no one was punished by this typo I altered the marking scheme and awarded only method marks for that part of the question. Having considered the results, I believe this was the right thing to do. Overall, many students did well on the exam. Some did not, although there was only a small number of fails.  	 Although the average score was ok, the exam showed that there are a gaps in the knowledge. I was particularly surprised to find that some of you could not deal with the simple angular momentum question A1, which was very similar to a problem we did in revision. The score on A2, which involved finding complex roots to a quartic (again a problem we pretty much did in revision), was not impressive. However, one should keep in mind that the complex number section was added to the syllabus this year so there was perhaps not the same amount of revision problems available for this. At this point in marking the exam I was concerned, because the first two problems really did not go as well as intended. However, after this this the standard of the student's solutions improved and in the end I think the exam went very well. Some students did spectacularly well.	24%	N.A.

Some students commnted that some of the problem sheets were too difficult.	43%		Feedback has been included on the blackboard page for the module and the students have been  informed of this by email.	This year it was necessary for me to give a brief lecture on the basics of complex numbers, as some students had not seen this material before.  However, a change will be made to MATH1008 for 2014-15 to eliminate this requirement.	Some small adjustments could be made to the question sheets, to reduce the amount and difficulty of some of the assignments.

MATH1008	Dr Daniel Nucinkis	Overall very well. 64.4 Average, only 8  students fail, including several who didn't take the exam suggesting that those that engaged with the material did well. The element of choice in the final exam clearly leads to selective learning: students know that they can focus on a part of the material and still pass: question B3 was attempted only by 1 in 4 students.    	Mostly 4-5, good results. Exceptions: Usefulness of feedback: largest number gave 3.    In written comments, most of the complaints were about tutorials (tutorial staff unapproachable or not engaging, not enough feedback on written work, questions harder than in lectures) or the level of delivery (either too fast or too slow, too hard or too easy).    The fast/slow problem is always a problem: some students' background is excellent and they're not challenged enough, some students' is weaker and they struggle.     Tutorial staff need clearer instruction on feedback, which I will implement next year, but this is a perennial problem. Approachability and similar issues is something that may need to be addressed at a higher level.      The weekly work  is  in part harder than  the examples done in class; this is to challenge the more able students, and to take all students beyond the basics.     	73%		Feedback will be included on the blackboard page for the module and the students will be informed of this by email within one week of the relevant exam board.

MATH1024	Dr Vesna Perisic, Prof Jonathan Forster	The assessment results were broadly in line with expectations for this module.  	There was a (not unusual) mix of messages from the evaluations, with the overall balance being positive. One thing which we need to consider for next year is clearer communication between the lecturers and the students on how the course is split between the lecturers and which parts of the syllabus are being covered by each lecturer. Another comment which arose more than once referred to the volume of material on the lecturer slides and the speed with which material was presented. This will be reviewed for next year.	56%		Feedback was included on the blackboard page for the module and the students were informed of this by email automatically.  	MINITAB was replaced by R this year. This was a success. It provides the students with a more useful skill,  one they are more likely to use going forward. The students rose to the challenge of learning a less intuitive software and generally used it very effectively in their project work.    We also gave the module a more mathematical and theoretical treatment this year (within the same syllabus). This was designed to make the transition to level 2 modules easier for the students. The assessment performances indicate that the students found these aspects tough. Consideration will be given as to how the more theoretical material can be most effectively taught.    A Facebook group was set up for the students to communicate with each other and with lecturers. This seemed to be successful and will be continued next year (but closed so that non-participants on the module cannot be disruptive)	See our responses to 2 and 11 above.

MATH1048	Dr Daniel Nucinkis	A significant number of failing marks: 53 (18%) even after scaling. Sixteen of these had marks 20 or below, so clearly were either out of place and/or not engaging with the material. It would be interesting to see how many failed students here and on other modules in semester one came in via clearing. 	Mostly fine: 4-5. Some complaints about lecturer's writing: 2-3. Feedack: more 3.    Module is seen as too hard, delivered too fast, with too much material, by a significant minority.     Feedback is always an issue: they don't like that we don't mark everything they do. Similarly that the module is too packed. I also feel there is too much materials to cover, which could be reduced. 	168%		Feedback will be included on the blackboard page for the module and the students will be informed of this by email within one week of the relevant exam board.

MATH1049	Dr Bernhard Koeck	The overall average has been lower than in previous years, but the performance at the top end of the class has been even more convincing than in previous years. The averages 47% for Part A and 56% for the (bookwork!) Question B2 and also the homework average 52% are particularly low. As to Part A, I appreciate that two or three of the multple-choice questions may have been too hard. The average for Question B2 was dragged down by part (d) about diagonalisibility which was new, but not unduely hard. Given that the attendance in tutorials and lectures was low this year and that the pile of uncollected tutorial sheets is probably three times as big than in previous years, I conclude that many students haven't taken studying during the semester seriously enough which resulted in the low homework average. 	I am very happy with the evaluation results. The students are particularly happy with the online lecture notes, with the feedback provided, with the organisation of the module and with my blackboard cleaning technique. Many students struggle with the more abstract content of the module. 	95%		Feedback will be included on the blackboard page for the module and the students will be informed of this by email within one week of the relevant exam board.	Using the online voting system Pingo at the start of each lecture turned out to be too awkward in terms of firing up the computer and the relevant software, so I abonded this at after a couple of weeks, but did use it again extensively in the revision week. 	If the overall academic standard of our students is not as good anymore as in previous years, then some abstract and hard bits of the syllabus may need to be cut out.

MATH1050	Dr Nicholas Wright	Given that this module is often regarded as the most challenging of the first semester modules in year one, it is very pleasing how well the students performed overall.	The students' comments indicate that they find this module very challenging, especially coming at this straight from A-level.  However the overall ratings indicate that students are appreciating the efforts put in to help the students succeed at this module, albeit with some considerable work on their part.	91%		Feedback will be included on the blackboard page for the module and the students will be informed of this by email within one week of the relevant exam board.	There were no significant changes to the module this year.	This module will nest year become the first part of the year-long Calculus module.  Given this significant change it makes sense to keep the material as similar as possible to this year.  One possible change would be to move to a system where alternate exercise sheets are marked in full, in place of partial marking of each exercise sheet.

MATH1051	Dr James Anderson	The use of multiple choice questions on the final examination continues to work well.  The multiple choice portion on this year's exam was longer than in the past few years, which I counterbalanced by making the other questions less complicated than in previous years (with the exception of question B 1(a)).  The results were not significantly different than in previous years.	First of all, I would like to thank you for taking the time to fill in the module evaluation questionnaires.  Overall, they indicate a generally high level of satisfaction with the module as it was taught.  There is the possibility that there will be a significant change to how this module is structured next year, but in the event of that, I'll endeavour to ensure that the comments you've made are fed into that restructuring.  I also plan to continue to develop the use of Twitter and Storify (and any other technology that might prove useful) in the teaching I do.     A number of people (though a minority of the class) commented that the tutorial sheets were too long, or that the questions were too hard, or that the marking scheme was too unforgiving.    The same comments were made last year, and my response this year is largely the same as it was last year, but interestingly, many fewer people made these comments this year than last, even though I made only minor changes to the lengths of the tutorial sheets.  Similarly a couple of people were dismayed that I did not allow the use of calculators in either the in-class test or the final examination.    I feel strongly that mathematics is a practice-based activity (as is juggling, if you remember the demonstration from early in the semester), and one of the reasons for having repetition on the tutorial sheets is to try and encourage people to get the practice they need in order to develop the skills that are being demonstrated in the lectures.  I don't feel that having only a single example of each sort of question, either that I'm presenting in lecture or that I'm asking you to work through on a tutorial sheet, is sufficient, any more than watching me juggle for 10 seconds is sufficient for you to learn how to juggle.  While I will continue to monitor the lengths of the tutorial sheets, I will need to balance the lengths of the sheets against the need to provide ample practice.  And I did have several requests this year for more practice examples.    I will admit that the marking scheme is unforgiving, but this is deliberate on my part, as I tried to explain when I set out the marking scheme at the beginning of the semester.   I feel that my having high expectations for the work you hand in is helpful to you in terms of your attitude towards that work.  After all, one of the skills that we are (implicitly) providing the opportunity and encouraging you to develop is the sense of knowing when your work is correct.  We all need to have faith that our calculations are correct.   External feedback on this is very important, hence the marking of some of the questions on each tutorial sheet.  But at university level, we should be moving away from requiring that every single thing we do be subject to external verification.  I will continue to explore ways of trying to make this explicit.      Following on from this, one thing that I feel it would be helpful for you to consider for future modules is the agglomeration of all of the sources of information you have about your understanding of the material in a module, beyond merely marks on coursework.  This will become particularly important if you are to take a module that is examination only, where there is no assessed coursework, but where there will still be feedback that you can and should make use of.  And this will be a very useful skill to take away from your university studies.    There were also some comments on the incompleteness of the printed notes and the fact that the printed notes did not exactly reflect the material presented in lectures.  The first comment I would like to make is that the printed notes were never intended to replace or supplant or reflect the material provided in lectures; rather, the printed notes were provided to give additional examples and provide explanatory material in addition to the material provided in lectures, as well as covering some of the main topics covered in the lectures.  I acknowledge that my rewriting of the printed notes during the semester was not entirely successful.  I'll ensure that this never occurs again.  	79%	Students greatly appreciated the use of Twitter to be able to ask questions during lectures.

MATH1052	Prof Christopher Howls	Broadly similar outcome to last year in terms of mean score.  Exam was broadly similar in standard to last year. Larger absolute number of failures due to larger class size and potential tail.	They seemed quite happy with the course overall.  They found the module interesting, they thought the organisation was good, they thought the material wasgenerally explained well, the quality of the printed notes, etc.... (all in the high 3.something or greater)    They ranked the amount of feedback as 3.9, with a usefulness of 3.8.  The coursework was about right.    The overall rating for the course lecturer was 3.9 and the course was 4.0    Note that the majority of the negative comments refer to the repetition of A-level material.  Given the large number of failures, this suggests that the class may be bifurcated.    Students complained about the poor timetabling of the lectures (including having a double lecture).    	67%	"Although I have ticked ""Yes"" to the preparedness of the students, there is clearly a large number in the tail.  Whether this is due to the significant expansion of numbers this year will remain to be seen.  The percentage of failures is not significantly different than last year."

There is some debate in Applied as to whether to include more material on dynamical systems.  However this must be placed in the context of a crowded syllabus, where Newton's laws and mechanics are part of this course.  We should aim to remove the latter from this course and bring back a proper mechanics applied module to Year 1.      Equally, considering the comments made by the students who found this subject repeating A-level and so boring:  the dynamical systems bit would please them, but many in the tail would struggle.

View this participant  The self teach aspect helps those who already know the material and don't need help and makes it much harder for those that may struggle. Furthermore the preferred text book Glenn-James is not helpful especially when you are already unsure on topic or the method of solving. Moreover there are merely 3 scheduled hours of help for the entirety of UoS engineering all years and only 3-4 Phd students present thus it is almost useless as it takes 30-40 minutes to be seen which when you wish to do other work or sport is totally infeasible. Overall a very poor way to teach the module.    View this participant  More test times would be appreciated perhaps 3 times a week.    View this participant  Getting first years to teach themselves Maths that is so fundamental and important to the entire degree seems extremely stupid to me. I am getting through the maths tests sure. But I haven't properly learnt a lot of the material like I would have if someone had actually taught it to me in a way that I could ask questions and improve my ability. In reality I tried to learn a lot of the stuff and understand it but a vast amount of it I don't properly understand and I'm extremely likely to forget because I taught myself to answer the questions.

View this participant  Although the idea of having a self-paced module is a good one I feel that with some modules I would have really benefited from a little extra help (eg. ODEs). With some modules I really struggled to teach it to myself. People can also very easily get behind on the tests.    View this participant  A few too many tests.    View this participant  I feel like there were many flaws to this module this year. I understand that at university you should be expected to do more individual study but I feel like the expectation of the amount of work that was required for the Math1054 module was simply too much. The first couple of topics were easy to learn and get through but the constant tests each week felt like you were simply learning material to pass a test but not so you would understand the subject completely. Again we knew this when we came here but with all the other modules that we have to do as well it felt like I was doing maths in my free time and only maths or other coursework’s for other modules and not learning the content in the way that was probably expected. With the tests being weekly it was also very easy to fall behind not because of a laissez-faire attitude but if you had more coursework for other modules and that took priority then you might not have had the time to do maths. There were several examiners/ phd students that would simply see if your solution matched the required answer without checking your work. If it did not match simply accused students of ‘not knowing what they were doing’ and one in particular questioned whether I’d learnt the required topic. Effectively hurling insults around without any benefit and then proceeded to not even try and help me understand where I’d gone so badly wrong. I must admit that this wasn’t the majority but when you do not understand something it’s even more frustrating that they were not willing to help one thing that I thought the tests were also for. Some others seemed to not have a clue what was going on either as if they’d never even done any of the maths before themselves that was incredibly unhelpful.

MATH1055	Prof Carsten Gundlach, Dr Daniel Nucinkis	Better than last year. Students engaged more with the material, see below. 	"Only 20% response. Need to improve communication to students about this. The self-paced administrator should take part. Responses mostly postive: most often 4, second highest 3 or 5.    Overall module rating: 4.3, positive. 14 students: 5, 9 students: 4.    Responses to ""bad features of the module"" follow. They are generally mild, the students clearly approve of the course much more than the parallel MATH1054, though it's essentially the same. ECS students have always been the highest motivated of the self-paced. It's as if the FEE students had taken a different course.    comments:    The self paced aspect is not good for people with poor time management and people often realise later into the course when the tests pile up at the end of term.

MATH2003	Dr Stephen Theriault	The assessment data is largely positive, especially on the key features of the quality of lectures and tutorials, and the student's overall interest in the module.     It might be noted that the number of responses to the survey was low, despite repeated reminders during the lectures. An investigation into how to improve the response rate will be made. 	The student feedback from the module evaluation was generally positive regarding the course material, organisation, and quality of lectures and tutorials.     There were a few comments regarding the wish for printed notes rather than the current scanned handwritten notes.     There were also a few comments regarding the possibility of more feedback through additional assessed work, with more timely marking. 	15%	Coursework marking was slow this year - but to be fair to the marker, the two courseworks were long and there was about 60 papers to mark. 	Feedback will be included on the blackboard page for the module and the students will be informed of this by email within one week of the relevant exam board.	The current syllabus is:<br />Revision form Linear Algebra II covering topics such as:<br />    <br />Matrix and disjoint cycle notation for permutations, expressing elements as products of transpositions, definitions and basic lemmas of abstract group theory: the uniqueness of the identity element and inverses<br />    <br />Permutation groups ; Matrix groups G1(n), S1(n), O(n), SO(n) ; The group of intergers mod n.<br />    <br />Cayley tables of small Symmetric Groups, Groups of Symmetries, dihedral groups (of small order)<br />    <br />Powers of elements<br />    <br />Order and generators for groups, orders of elements – examples<br />    <br />Isomorphism and exmaples<br />    <br />Cyclic groups and their classification.<br />    <br />Any symmetric group is generated by transpositions<br />    <br />Odd and even permutations and the Alternating group<br />    <br />Conjugacy and conjugacy classes; example: cycle structures in symmetric groups and the relationship with conjugacy classes.<br />    <br />Definition and examples of subgroups and Lagrange's theorem; examples including cyclic groups and the Symmetric Groups<br />    <br />Testing for a subgroup. Intersections of subgroups are subgroups<br />    <br />Isomorphisms, their properties and the classification of small groups<br />    <br />Direct products and the internal direct product theorem<br />    <br />Normal subgroups, centre of a group, Cosets and quotient groups<br />    <br />Homomorphisms, kernel and image;the First Isomorphism Theorem<br />    <br />Group actions and Cayley’s theorem<br />    <br />Orbit stabiliser theorem and applications; the action of the dihedral groups on geometric features of regular n-gons, the rotation group of a cube is isomorphic to the symmetric group on 4 letters.<br />    <br />Burnside’s formula and its applications to enumeration of orbits e.g, counting seating plans, necklaces coloured dice<br />    <br />Application of group actions to finite group theory: Class equation, finite p-groups, Sylow’s theorems and their applications.  	Possibly the number of courseworks could be increased from 2 to 3, and each made proportionately smaller. This would give more instances of feedback, and likely speed up the marking process.

MATH2008	Dr David Jones	The results for this module were broadly in line with those of previous years, aside from a slightly weaker performance of the class on the final exam as compared to previous years.	I carried out informal feedback relatively early in the module, and received some useful information.  In response, I increased the speed with which I went through example questions in the weekly tutorial.	17%		"Feedback will be included on the blackboard page for the module and the students will be informed of this by email within one week of the relevant exam board.

I think this was a real improvement; the students seemed to find it interesting, and it made it easier to discuss the problem of motion in a gravitational field later in the module.	The addition of a little more theory related to motion in a central force, building upon the change described above, would improve this module further.

MATH2011	Dr Alan Kimber	This may be regarded as an applied calculus course. The mark distribution for this module was in line with the MATH1050 (Calculus I) and MATH1051 (Calculus II) results last year for this cohort of students. 	The module evaluation results are broadly very positive. It is good that the students appreciated the quick turnaround of the feedback for the class tests.  A small issue of how quickly the solutions to non-assessed exercises should become available on Blackboard was dealt with as a result of the week 5 informal feedback process.	40%	Re q4: The syllabus is rather full, so I only had time to discuss Bayesian inference and the multinomial distribution very briefly. It may be that a small amount of trimming of the syllabus is desirable.  Re q5: A subset of the class were very sloppy when using some basic mathematical techniques such as integration. I posted relevant revision material on Blackboard but I suspect that some students unwisely did not make full use of this material. 	Feedback was included on the blackboard page for the module and the students were informed of this by email within one week of the relevant exam board.	The current syllabus is:<br />Random variables; probability, probability density and cumulative distribution functions; Expected value and variance of a random variable. Bernoulli trials, binomial, Poisson, geometric, hypergeometric, negative binomial distributions, and their inter-relationships. Poisson process.

The tutorial session was at a more civilised time this year and I also asked for it immediately to follow a lecture slot. Tutorial attendance certainly seemed higher this year. 	Overall I think the module worked well this year. I made some use of Mathematica demos in lectures to illustrate some ideas in a dynamic rather than static way. I think that it is worth considering extending this aspect of the lecture delivery. 	Module lead	Save and Submit	1839071	Dr Alan Kimber	1394539339	80	0	20	no	yes	yes	yes	yes	yes
MATH2013	Dr Athanasios Avramidis, Dr Patrick Beullens	"This ""Module review"" thing does not seem to work as I would expect. I have filled in a detailed report, then emailed my colleague Thanos to comment, before I prese the ""submit"" buttion. Now I find out that everything is apparently ""reset"". So I will be brief.     Assessment: in line with expectations. Overall an improvement compared to last year - relatively less students at the bottom. Coursework in general high marks - students indeed work hard. Exam is much more difficult, and aims to distinguish the brightest from the bright: exam results this year are improved which explains the overall better result compared to last year."	About 30% of students have responded via iSurvey - still low but still a much better response rate than last year's. (We have put more effort in repeating our request to give us feedback). Overall results are rather excellent this year.    We have also performed the informal feedback round following the procedure set out by A. Kimber. We received overall very good feedback on that. We have replied by e-mail to all students about which points we could improve now, which ones we may consider for next year, and which suggestions are difficult to implement and why. 	13%	Yes. We have managed to provide written and personalised feedback on the LP coursework within one week (last year, because the involvement of several assessors, logistical problems caused it to take us 3 weeks). Students appreciated this.	Feedback will be included on the blackboard page for the module and the students will be informed of this by email within one week of the relevant exam board.	"Changes were made to the delivery of the material, where TIMELY FEEDBACK was the key aim, by the introduction of:  * more emphasis during lectures and tutorials on typical pitfalls - it is for learning not only important to teach the correct way of thinking, but to show how not to think and why (based on our experience from teaching previous cohorts)  * we introduced a series of Quizzes (multiple choice questions mostly, with answers); each Quiz e-mailed to students when a certain topic was completed.   * In each tutorial, we distributed a hardcopy of one or two ""exam-style"" questions, to reward those present and also to show the level of difficulty they can expect.   * Regularly reminding students that they can visit us during office hours (e.g. Wed 1-2pm) for individual support, which indeed some students responded to.  Based on student's informal and iSurvey feedback, this seems to have paid off. "	We think the content and materials are now Ok, with minor modifications and further improvements still possible. For example, every exercise or example should be carefully chosen and lead to some important more general insights that can be explicity formulated and incorporated in the lecture delivery strategy.   Most importantly, we must strive to repeat the success of this year by keeping TIMELY FEEDBACK strategies at the forefront of our mind.     Patrick Beullens and Thanos Avramides, 14 Feb, 2014.

MATH2014	Dr Maria Battarra	I believe the exam was ok, but students in this cohort are very heterogeneous (many first class and many low marks)	"Students were in general pleased with the module. There are still a few students that find the computer-based quizzes challenging (and would expect very ""similar questions"" in the mock quiz on the Blackboard), but I believe the quizzes are motivating them to study harder for the final exam. This year I ended the program one hour late in the revision week. This is due to the fact that I missed 4 hours of teaching due to bank holidays, I did two 1-hour feedback sessions (after each of the quizzes) and 1-hour session for the informal feedback and related comments. It would be wise to ask to reschedule the 2-hours slot out of Monday. This would allow to miss less classes.

MATH2015	Dr Marco Caldarelli	The results of the examination were good. Most of the students picked the questions on linear algebra with success. Many students worked out correctly the questions on Fourier transforms and ODE, but very few tried to answer to the PDE questions.	The results of the exam are positive overall. Some comments on each question:    Q1 - Most of the students picked this question of linear algebra and solved the problem correctly    Q2 - Many students chose this question. The first part (a,b and c) was an eigenvalue/eigenvector problem and was solved correctly, but the second part, that was a straightforward application of the results of the previous points to a simple system of coupled ODEs, was not solved as well. The link between the last point and the previous ones should have been clearer to the students.    Q3 - This questions was answered quite well by the students. Evaluating the series in particular points (question d) seems to be where the students have more difficulties.    Q4 - Students choosing this question did well overall. Some students should become more   proficient at differentiating and manipulating algebraic expressions    Q5 - Few people chose to solve PDEs. This was a simple PDE to solve with the method of characteristic curves, similar to examples given in class, but only a few students handled it successfully.    Q6 - This question was picked by very few students. It was an easy PDE question, and very similar to a problem I insisted on during revision week; it should have been an easy pick for everybody, but students tend to prefer longer linear algebra questions to easy PDE questions..	8%	-	Feedback will be included on the blackboard page for the module and the students will be informed of this by email within one week of the relevant exam board.

MATH2040	Prof James Vickers	There was a problem with class test one. The coursework was therefore scaled to give an average of 60%. The exam was also scaled to bring the pass/fail borderline and B/C borderline to the appropriate point. 	The original lecturer for this module Dr Oertel was a lecturer who was new to Southampton and had not taught this material before and obtained a very poor overall evaluation. There are many negative comments from the students relating to the first half of the module.     We became aware of the problems with the lecturer about halfway through the module and the last third was taught by Dr Kennedy. He obtained an excellent rating from the students obtaining a score of over 4.5. Overall the module scored an average of 2.8 which is significantly lower than in prewvious years. it was clear ffom the written comments that this was largely due to the problems at the start of the module where there were problems with the material covered by the lecturer and the style of the lectures. There were some positive comments about the new set book. 	45%	As explained above the initial lecturer deviated to some extent from the module specification - spending time on some aspects that were not central to the module. This was corrected by Dr Kennedy and the students performed well on quite a testing exam (which was set by Professor Vickers who had taught the module the previous year). 	Feedback has been  included on the blackboard page for the module and the students have been informed of this by email.  	The current syllabus is effectively set by the requirements that it satisfy the exemption requirements of the FIA.  The current syllabus is:   :<br /><ul>  <li>Simple and compound interest. Time value of money, rate of interest, rate of discount, and force of interest. Accumulated values and discounted values. Accumulation and discounting of a (possibly infinite) cash flow to a given time, where both the rate of cash flow and the force of interest may be time-varying.</li>  <li>Relationships between rates of interest and discount over different time periods. Nominal rates, effective rates, rates payable multiple times per annum.</li>  <li>Definition of the standard compound interest functions and relationships between them.</li>  <li>Generalised cash flow modelling. Equation of value for a cash flow problem, and methods of solution.</li>  <li>Loans. Equation of value corresponding to periodic repayment of a loan. Interest and capital content of annuity payments where the annuity is used to repay a loan.</li>  <li>Net present value (NPV), accumulated profit, and internal rate of return (IRR) for investment projects.</li>  <li>Investment project appraisal using NPV and IRR. Real rate of return in presence of inflation.</li>  <li>Measurement of investment performance.</li>  <li>Ordinary shares. Constant dividend growth model of share valuation. Fixed-interest securities. Present value and redemption yield for a fixed-interest security, including effects of taxation.</li>  <li>Yield curves and the term structure of interest rates.</li>  <li>Investment and risk characteristics of standard asset classes (Government fixed-interest securities, other fixed-interest securities, equities, etc.) available for investment purposes.</li>  <li>Discounted mean term, volatility. Matching of assets and liabilities, immunization.</li>  <li>Simple stochastic interest rate models. Mean, variance, and distribution function for the accumulated amount of an initial investment, and applications.</li>  <li>Forward interest rates. Forward contracts. The concept of no-arbitrage pricing and its use in determining the fair value of a forward contract.</li>  </ul>	The main enhancement will be to revert to the use of an experienced Southampton lecturer for the whole of the module.

MATH2044	Prof Konstantinos Skenderis	The performance of the students in this module was very good. All students that actively followed this module (attended the lectures, took the quizzes etc.) achieved a passing mark and many got more than 70%. I believe the preparation for the quizzes helped the students to keep up with the material and also the quizzes gave them a quick feedback on how they are doing. This helped them to prepare well for the final exam.     Some of the issues I noticed last year (students not fluent with basic differentiation, solving (easy) differential equations, basics in linear algebra (e.g. definitions of eigenvalues, trace, determinant etc.) and complex analysis (e.g. taking norms of complex functions etc.)  ) are still present. It is also still the case the many students appear to be weak on the physics background (e.g. familiarity with notions of force, energy, work etc.) needed for the last part of the course. The last part of this course on electromagnetism remains the most difficult part of this module.  	This module was received well by the students. Their evaluation on all aspects of this module was positive. In particular, the students evaluated very positively the initiative of having quizzes instead of more traditional homework style coursework. Based on this feedback, I will continue having quizzes next year. The structure of the lectures and tutorials was also evaluated positively so I will continue without major changes.  There were a couple of comments about the last part of the module (electromagnetism) and I believe this part needs some further improvement (more below on question 12).	21%	Regarding question 4: there is no need to major updating but see answer to question 12.  Regarding question 5, see answer to question 1.	Feedback will be included on the blackboard page for the module and the students will be informed of this by email within one week of the relevant exam board.	The current syllabus is:<br /><p>PART A: TENSOR CALCULUS<br /><br />1. <strong>Cartesian Tensors</strong><br /><br /> Cartesian tensors and index notation: Vector identities using index notation; Levi – Civita symbol;<br /><br /><strong>2. Applications of tensors</strong><br /><br />Rate of strain tensor in fluid dynamics, strain tensor in solid mechanics, Axial vectors as antisymmetric tensors;  Constitutive equations for linear anisotropic media.<br /><br />PART B: INVISCID FLUID DYNAMICS<br /><br />3. <strong>Basic Definitions</strong><br /><br />Streamlines; rate of change; pressure.<br /><br />4. <strong>Fundamental equations</strong><br /><br />Equation of continuity; Euler’s equation and its boundary conditions; Bernoullis equation<br /><br />5. <strong>Simple fluid flows</strong><br /><br />Examples of simple flows; two dimentional, steady, irrotational, incompressible flow.<br /><br />6. <strong>Complex potentials</strong><br /><br />Basic theory; Derivaton of complex potentials for particular flows; complex potentials in the presence of boundaries; Schwarz-Christoffel mapping; force on bodies.<br /><br />PART C: ELECTROMAGNETISM<br /><br />7. <strong>Electrostatics</strong><br /><br />Definition of electric field; Maxwell’s equations for an electric field; Existence and uniqueness of the solution to the electrostatic equation; Scalar potential;Ohm's Law.<br /><br />8. <strong>Magnetism</strong><br /><br />Definition of magnetic field; Vector potential; Maxwell equations.<br /><br />9. <strong>Light and</strong> <strong>electromagnetic waves</strong><br /><br />Derivation of the wave equation; solution of the wave equation in vacuum; plane wave limit; polarisation of a light wave.<br /><br /><br /> </p>      The main changes I made to this module this year were:    -I replaced the homework style part of the coursework work by 4 quizzes, each covering 25% of the material. For each quiz I provided a list of questions a week or two before the quiz and one of these questions (or a variant of it) was in the quiz. This worked very well as the questions provided guidance for revision and also the quizzes helped the student to keep up with the material in the course.    -I added more introductory material on physics concepts and on mathematical prerequisites in the last part of this module (electromagnetism).  I think this helped the students to follow more easily the material in this part of the module.  	 The weakest part of this module is the last part on electromagnetism. This part is somewhat unbalanced. It consists of three chapters: one on electrostatics, one on magnetism and one on light and electromagnetic waves.  The chapters on magnetism and light and electromagnetic waves are too brief  (not having enough examples and introductory material) while the chapter on electrostatics contains advanced material that could be omitted in a course that only aims to cover the very basics.  I suggest that one removes the discussion of electric dipoles and of Ohm’s law from this chapter and develop more the other two chapters by including more examples and introductory material.

MATH2045	Dr Marika Taylor, Prof Timothy Sluckin	No.	MATH2045 has in most years been considered a rather difficult module and a number of students are not enthusiastic about it from the start but need to attend because it is compulsory in their programs. We are doing our best to engage with these students and get them through the module.    This is the second year that the module has been taught by Tim Sluckin and myself, and we have made several improvements relative to last year (extended complex variable theory notes, changes to tutorial classes). 	25%	Both courseworks were marked within a week and feedback was given on Blackboard and in tutorial classes.     The class test was marked within a week and detailed feedback was given on Blackboard and in a tutorial class.     Students who studied the coursework solutions and class test solutions generally did very well in the exam and several commented to me that the feedback was helpful.	Feedback was included on the blackboard page for the module and the students were informed of this by email within one week of the relevant exam board.	The main change was extension of the complex variable theory notes to include many more diagrams, explanations and examples. Students did perform much better in the complex variable theory part of the exam relative to previous years. 	Next year I would like to improve the performance of the weakest students. MATH2045 is in the first semester of the second year and a number of students find it difficult to adjust to the change in support provided in the second year - without weekly marked homeworks, they do not study the material.     We do not have the resources to mark homeworks each week but I will be looking into possible adjustments to the coursework to make it more effective for the weakest students. For example, MATH2044 has this year piloted a system of quizzes in which students study a number of questions and then complete one every few weeks in class, under test conditions. A similar system for MATH2045 might help the weaker students engage with the material more.	Module lead	Save and Submit	2175371	Dr Marika Taylor	1394097768	80	14	6	no	no	yes	yes	yes	yes
MATH2047	Dr Giles Richardson, Prof Timothy Sluckin	The overall exam performance was very good and demonstrated that most students had really got to grips with the material. On a question by question basis Q1, Q2 & Q3 (Laplace transforms, Eigenvalues & Separation of Variables) were all done very well with only the final part of Q3 (in which the coefficients in the series solution of the PDE are determined by fitting to the initial data) proving a problem to a significant number of people. Q4 (complex numbers) was not done so well (but still not badly) - very few people got the final part in which you were asked to write down the complex representation of u+jv (but this is perhaps not surprising as it is quite hard).	This was the first time the module was given and I think that although the module evaluation results were not bad they should improve once the course settles down. Unfortunately I believe that there will be a large number of changes to the syllabus this coming semester and so this might not happen until 2015/16.	11%	Students have very little knowledge of Fourier Series and this is required for separation of variables. Also the section of complex variables seems surplus to requirements and so we a proposing adding Fourier Series at the expense of complex variables.	Feedback will be included on the blackboard page for the module and the students will be informed of this by email within one week of the relevant exam board.	This is the first time this module has been given.	The revised course will probably look like    -  2nd order ODEs  -  Laplace Transforms  -  Eigenvalue problems (including Sturm-Liouville)  -  Fourier series and transforms  -  Separation of variables    (notably complex variables have been dropped and Fourier analysis added)	Module lead	Save and Submit	1986163	Dr Giles Richardson	1394105711	80	20	0	no	yes	no	yes	yes	yes
MATH2048	Prof James Vickers	Most students attended lectures diligently and attempted the weekly problem sheets. They also worked hard on the coursework, obtaining justifiably high marks. This was a new module and as a result the examination questions, although of an appropriate standard, were fairly straightforward. As a result the majority of students who had worked hard on this module also obtained good marks in the exam.     Most students engaged well with the Statistics component of MATH2048, through questions and discussions in the computer labs and revision lectures. This is reflected in the large number of high to very high marks in the coursework and the exam section on Statistics.	The student comments on the lectures and the content of the course were all postive. Some students would have preferred smaller tutorial groups but overall the students thought the tutorials were well run. A number of students would have liked coursework returned through the Faculty Office (as happens in Engineering) and I will investigate if this is possible for next year. 	2%	I think more time is needed for the section on vector calculus, so this will require reducing the time spent on some other parts of the module (probably the first section on 2nd order ODEs).	Feedback will be included on the blackboard page for the module and the students will be informed of this by email within one week of the relevant exam board.	The current syllabus is:    ODE boundary value problems and Sturm-Liouville problems  Fourier series: real and complex  Fourier transforms  Linear partial differential equations: Classification of second order PDEs, the principle of superposition, separation of variables.    Mech, Ship, Aero, ISVR only:  Laplace transforms  Vector calculus    Civil Engineering only:    Further Statistics, including use of Minitab      This was the first year the module was given so there were no changes to syllabus were relevant. For the Statistics component, the proportion of computer labs/tutorials was higher than in the comparable module given in previous years. This led to better student engagement, and subsequently a higher marks profile.	"As sated above there will be no changes to the overall syllabus but slighlty more emphasis will be placed on the vector calculus component. I also intend to supplement the materil on Blackboard by a number of video ""overview lectures"" for some of the key topics.    For the Statistics component, it is planned to introduce more student interaction into the lectures. For example, instead of going through examples on slides, the lecturer will develop the answer on the board jointly with the students.

MATH3012	Prof Zudi Lu	As a new staff member first teaching this module, I am happy that all the class of Math3012 of 2013-14 did achieve well. Among 71 students who sat the final exam, all of them passed the module in total marks (while only 4 students got raw exam marks lower than 40). Clearly, the students did well in learning this module though I knew that some of them could have done better if they were more active and positive in attending the lectures and tutorials.	I would say thank you to all student feedback. As an international academic staff member with English not the first language, I realised that some of the students might have some concerns over my speaking. In the future teaching, I would try to speak more slowly and write more clearly on whiteboard to help students and also encourage students to be more concentrtated in class and active in asking questions. I am more than happy to help all students in person in learning Statistics. It shall of ocurse be stressed that what I teach is Statistics.	20%	Though only a small portion of students (only about 20 among more than 70) in the class of Math3012 of 2013-14 participated in the online iSurvey,  which might make it with biased information in evaluation, I did find that it provided helpful information to understand the students (at least a portion of the students) and their possible behaviours, attitudes and actions in learning this module. 	Feedback was included on the blackboard page for the module and the students were informed of this by email within one week of the relevant exam board.	The current syllabus is:<br /><p>The module consists of 12 weeks of lectures. The topics for the weeks are roughly as follows:<br />Week 1: Introduction. Revision of distribution theory.<br />Weeks 2-4: Revision of linear models and statistical inference.<br />Weeks 5-9: GLMs: theory and application.<br />Weeks 10-11: Log-Linear models and contingency tables.<br />Week 12: Exam preparation</p>    This is my first year teaching this module as a new staff member at this university.    	Some changes will be made to enhance the module, accoring to studnets' comments that look feasible. In the teaching of next year, I would try to write more clearly on whiteboard and speak more slowly and clearly to help students and also try to motivate students to be more active and positive in learning and active in asking questions. It would also be helpful to learn from other colleagues' experiences, such as how to provide students with qualitative individual feedback with pieces of coursework marked by a Teaching Assistant.

Individual feedback provided.  - More examples were included in the lectures  - The order of presenting the material changed  These were all positively received by the students as indicated in the module questionnaire.    Simulation Labs:  None	Main Lectures:  The notes must be modified to reflect the new order adopted this year as well as omissions. Home assignments must be run in a more organized way, to give students enough time to work through them, and to give them feedback in a short period.    Simulation Labs:    A few students felt that help with the simulation coursework could be better. Having well-trained PhD demonstrators is one helpful element in this direction. An introductory lecture to Simul8, at an appropriate time during the term, will be considered.    	Module lead	Save and Submit	2102447	Dr Navid Izady	1404836412	60	40	0	no	no	yes	yes	yes	yes
MATH3014	Dr Kalliopi Mylona	No problems with the coursework and the exam	Most of the complaints was about the fact that I do not give solutions to the past paper exams. I tried to deal with that by dedicated the revision week on answering questions with respect to the past papers. The students tried to solve the past exams by themselves and I answered at any question that they had. Also some complaints were about the fact that the tutorial exercises do not count at all at the final mark. However, I believe this should remain the same, since it is a third year module and the coursework and the exam should be enough for assessment. The feedback in the middle of the semester it was very helpful. I tried to improve my writing on the board.	12%		Feedback will be included on the blackboard page for the module and the students will be informed of this by email within one week of the relevant exam board.

MATH3022	Prof Christopher Howls, Dr Ramin Okhrati	The assessment outcomes of the cohort were broadly similar to that of the previous year.      	Students always find this module challenging.  The syllabus is dictated by the need to meet the IFoA external accreditation.      The overall module score this year was lower than previous years.  This was the first year that the module had split teaching.  This may have affected the student experience.  The decision to teach jointly is a matter for AU Group heads, not the course lecturers.    There is a very low response rate for the module questionnaire, despite repeated reminders in class to complete the form.	17%		Feedback will be included on the blackboard page for the module and the students will be informed of this by email within one week of the relevant exam board.	The current syllabus is:<br /><ul>  <li>Utility functions</li>  <li>Assessment and measurement of investment risk: distribution of return, variance of return, downside semi-variance of return, shortfall probabilities, Value at risk (VaR, Tail VaR). Role of investors utility function.

MATH3023	Dr Christine Currie, Miss Marion Penn	The marks are within the expected range for the limited number of students on the module, taking into account the fact that we use a selection process to decide who can complete the module.	The module evaluation scores were very good, but there were some recurring themes. In particular, students were concerned about the content of the final report and what was expected of them in the special project. 	9%	The learning outcomes in the module specification were updated for this year.    As the presentations were held over a number of weeks and we wished to release   all of the marks together it was not possible to release marks within 4 weeks of   submission.  Also we experienced difficulties in obtaining feedback from one of the   teachers on a student and were waiting to be able to send the teacher feedback with the other feedback.   Changes will be made to reduce the chances of this problem occuring again in future.	There was no exam.  Detailed individual feedback on the report and presentation  along with comments from the teacher they worked with in has been sent to students.	We adjusted the word count of the report to exclude tables and references this resulted in significantly fewer complaints about the word count.    We included a wider variety of interactive/active learning teching techniques  within tutorials to demonstrate the types of techniques they might experience in school or wish to use for special projects.  The session demonstrating the zappers to students was particularly well recieved, as was the inclusion of example lesson 'starters' in lectures.    We also used panopto lecture recording to make recordings of sessions available to students.  The module evaluation questionairre responses show that this was well recieved although not used to a great extent.  There was an issues with one of the recordings but generally it worked well.	More guidance needs to be given on writing the final report as many students were confused about what material should be included in it.    Similarly, students worried a great deal about their special project, and would appreciate more guidance on this early on.

MATH3033	Dr James Anderson	The students performed very well on the examination.   	(as sent to the students) First of all, many thanks to all of you who responded.  The evaluations were positive overall, and I am happy that y'all seemed to enjoy the topic and how it was presented.  The two main issues you raised in terms of things to change for next year are     1. the lack of assessed coursework, and   2. the choice of textbook and the related issue of the provision of lecture notes.    1. It is true that MATH3033 at present has no formally assessed coursework.  This is a piece of information that was available to you when you decided to take this module as opposed to others, and in fact there is the view that having modules with a wide range of assessment patterns, ranging from 100% final examination through to modules with large coursework components, is to your benefit, allowing you to take advantage of the strengths of how you work.    In addition to the regular problem sheets (for which solutions are provided), the bi-weekly tutorial session, and weekly office hours, I introduced this year the Question of the Week in an attempt to introduce an element of (informally) assessed coursework.  A few people commented favourably on the Question of the Week, and the only negative comment was around the lack of involvement with it as the semester went on, and so I plan on keeping the Question of the Week in future years that I teach this module, though I will give thought to how best to encourage participation.    It has also become clear to me that you take a narrower view of what constitutes coursework than I do.  I had always felt that the provision of problem sheets, together with the solutions, and tutorial sessions and office hours to handle any questions, was a significant element of coursework and gave you ample opportunity to determine how well you were coming to terms with the material we covered.  However, from the comments made, it seems that unless the work is marked by me and is part of the formal assessment for the module, you don't consider it coursework.     And so, in response to all of these comments, I have submitted a proposal to the Mathematical Sciences Programme Committee to include an element of assessed work next year, so that the balance of assessment changes to 80% final examination and 20% coursework, in line with many of the other third year modules.   If approved, this coursework will probably consist of 1 in-class test and 1 longer piece of coursework, but I'll make the final decision a bit later in the year.    To close on this topic, in the additional survey I had roughly the same number of comments that the problem sheet questions and the Questions of the Week were too hard as I had that they were too easy and harder problems were needed.  The limited number of responses to the questionnaire I ran on the level of difficulty of the questions asked over the semester gave a spread of 2.5 to 4.3, with most responses coming in between 3 and 4.  Combining these two, I feel confident that the questions are at the right level.  I will of course keep an eye on this in future years.    2. This year, we used Wallis's book, which seemed to go down well with several positive comments and the only negative comment being that the book contained more material than we covered in the module.  (This will be the case with any book used for a module such as this, given the breadth of the topic.)  I tried to note which chapters and sections were relevant, and I will improve on this next year, both in terms of keeping the assigned reading up to date and also in terms of stating more clearly which results in the book are being presented in the lectures.    One issue here, though one raised by only a few people, is that there was some confusion about which material would be examinable, and this led to some questions being asked in the weeks leading up to the exam.  It is difficult to give precise answers to some of these questions without actually stating what questions will be asked on the exam, but again I will endeavour to improve next year my discussions of what material your successors will be responsible for knowing for the final examination, and more importantly,  what material won't be examinable.    As we are using a specific textbook, there seems to be no clear reason to provide printed lecture notes, since essentially all of the material covered, with the exception of some examples, comes from Wallis's book.  One possibility would be for me to produce example sheets to supplement Wallis's book, which I will give serious consideration to.    There is nothing that I can do directly about the timetable.  I'm aware that late Tuesday afternoon is a sub-optimal time for concentration, but not all modules can be scheduled between 10am and 3pm, unfortunately.   I will also continue to use Twitter/Storify to capture your questions, and in fact I may make that the standard route for answering all questions, including those sent via email.  	21%	There is currently no coursework for this module, and so Question 8 above is not relevant.  The module profile needs updating to include random graphs, and also to minimise the overlap with MATH2014 Algorithms.  A proposal to change the module syllabus by adding random graphs and removing the material on flows in directed graphs has been submitted for consideration by the AUPC.	Feedback will be included on the blackboard page for the module and the students will be informed of this by email within one week of the relevant exam board.	I introduced the use of Twitter to provide students with a route to ask questions without having to speak up during the lecture, which seemed to be popular with some students and which I'll continue in the future.  I also for the first time used Storify to capture the tweets from students, along with expanded written answers from me where relevant.  Again, this seemed to be well-received, and I will developed this further in the future.	Refining the syllabus as described above, improving the use of Twitter/Storify, which includes using Storify to answer emailed questions from students as well as those asked via Twitter.  I have also proposed to the AUPB that an element of assessed coursework (probably one in-class test and one piece of coursework) be introduced, to bring the balance of assessment to 80% final examination and 10% coursework.

MATH3044	Dr Stefanie Biedermann	Most students did very well on both the coursework and the exam.	The module evaluation results are quite positive. The one more mediocre area is feedback to students, since the module questionnaires opened before the coursework hand-in date. I have already rearranged the order in which I teach the material, so the coursework marks were available before Christmas this academic year. To improve student satisfaction with feedback, I consider to have a short informal quiz at the end of each chapter, which can be used as formative assessment/feedback.  	13%		Feedback has been included on the blackboard page for the module and the students have been informed of this by email within one week of the relevant exam board.

MATH3063	Dr Gerard Kennedy, Dr Erengul Dodd	The students who got 50-59% was unusually low this year. There is no obvious explanation for this.	Module was generally well received. Some students wanted the theory and application more balanced (more time given to worked examples). This is partly due to the nature of the course, which develops theory in the first half and applies in the second.	31%	Marker for Class Test I had to take over responsibility for another module at very short notice. This caused a slight delay to feedback on Class Test I.	  Feedback on the exam was made available via Blackboard.	The early descriptive material on mortality was covered more quickly than in previous years. However, the time devoted to this material still needs to be shortened.

MATH3066	Dr Ramin Okhrati, Dr Erengul Dodd	The average is a little lower compared to the previous years. However the distribution of the marks is normal which means that the cohort is slightly weaker. The other reason of low average is that there are couple of students who had extremely low marks [between 0 and 9].	The students were very satisfied with the module and rated the module highly. The overall performance was satisfactory and the evaluation results show a clear improvement compared to the last year. Students really liked the red book which contains problem sets, past exam papers and class tests with solutions. 	23%		Feedback is included on the blackboard page for the module and the students were informed of this by email.	We followed the same syllabus as the last year. The lecture notes were uploaded on the blackboard weekly which was appreciated by the students. Since they liked the red book last year, we updated it this year and distributed on the first day of the term.       	Students asked to reduce the number of questions in the final exam. This is also suggested by the external examiners. Therefore we are going to reduce the exam time from 3 hours to 2 hours.     The feedback for the first class test was given on the 4th week. A few students complained about the late return of the results. This was due to one of the lecturers (RO) sickness. However, the lecturer continued teaching and this did not affect the quality of the teaching in any way. The return of the feedback can be improved next year.     Since the pension section was not included in the class test, few students found it difficult in the final exam. Next year a question about this section can be asked in the second class test to prepare them better for the final exam.

I incorporated more examples and removed the last section so as to give the module at a more measured pace. At the same time I used all the time slots for tutorials (not just the 6 per semester) allotted which gave a total of 4 hours/week. This allowed for a slower, more detailed explanation of all points. This made the material more accessible to students and was reflected in student comments and performance.	increasing the part on dispersion relations and decreasing the wave guide section.

MATH3072	Dr Benjamin Macarthur	The students generally engaged well with the material and performance in assessment was correspondingly good. More than expected obtained >70%. In future years more challenging material will be introduced to distinguish the strongest students. 	The student feedback for the module was generally very good. As with previous years, a number requested more comprehensive lecture notes. The notes provided cover all the course material, although examples are omitted in order to encourage students to attend the lectures and engage more proactively with the material (full solutions to all worked examples are provided in class). A few students do not like this, and request complete printed solutions to all the worked examples in class. However, this method generally works well and encourages a more collaborative problem solving atmosphere so I do not intend to update the notes to include full solutions to examples covered in class. A number requested additional biological flows to be included in the course material, and I intend to accommodate this request in future years while maintaing the balance between examples and general theory.	12%		Feedback will be included on the blackboard page for the module and the students will be informed of this by email within one week of the relevant exam board.	The syllabus for the module was not changed this year.     The current syllabus is:<br /><p><strong>1 Background </strong><br />   What is biological fluid dynamics?<br />   Vector and tensor calculus<br /><strong>2 Descriptions of Fluids</strong><br />    Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates<br />    Conservation equations<br />    Constitutive laws<br />    The Navier-Stokes equations<br />    Boundary conditions<br /><strong>3 Exact Solutions to the Navier-Stokes Equations</strong><br />    Poiseuille and Couette flow<br />    Drainage of tear films<br />    Blood flow<br /><strong>4 Approximate Solutions to the Navier-Stokes Equations</strong><br />    Nondimensionalisation<br />    Large Reynolds number flows<br />    Small Reynolds number flows<br />    The Lubrication Approximation<br />    The Slow Flow Approximation<br />    Two-dimensional Stokes flow<br />    Stokes flow past a sphere</p>	Introduction of more challenging material will be introduced at the end of the main module sections for next year. This will provide more advanced material for the keenest students to engage with (there were a number who would have profited from such material this year). This material will form the basis for a small number of coursework and exam questions, in order to better distinguish very strongest students.

MATH3076	Dr Nicholas Wright	Broadly the assessment was successful.  Question 3 on the exam was not answered well: this was bookwork, however it was quite technical and also different to questions that had appeared in previous years which I think was the cause of the difficulties.  In future it would be worth being watchful of the amount of highly technical material on the paper.	The students raised a couple of points in the evaluations that could help to improve the module.  The first is that the overall quantity of material covered is too great.  The reorganisation of material this year gave greater focus and more time spend on the early chapters, but this meant rushing through some of the later material.  The second point raised was about the class test (new this year).  This was late in the semester and consequently covered most of the module content.  It would be better to make the test more focused.	22%	Feedback for both the coursework and the class test were given in under 2 weeks.	Feedback will be included on the blackboard page for the module and the students will be informed of this by email within one week of the relevant exam board.	The material was reorganised this year.  This was overall beneficial and gave the module more structure.  The balance of time spent on each area now needs fine-tuning.    The assessment as also modified this year, moving to one coursework and one class test instead of two courseworks.  This helped to ensure that students got helpful and timely feedback.	The amount of material to be covered in lectures needs to be reduced.  This will be achieved be reducing the amount of time covering material which is familiar from previous modules and by setting some of the less critical material as self-study exercises.    As mentioned above the class test should be improved by focusing it on a section of the module, rather than the whole module.

MATH3077	Dr Armando Martino	The comments seem in line with previous years.	The feedback seemed both useful (3.6) and timely, according to the comments.  	21%	I believe this this module requires a serious review, as the content is both too broad and too disparate. I would very strongly urge that this be undertaken for next year (and I am happy to volunteer as part of the team that does this.) I believe a very strong case can be made that this material can and should be delivered in a way which supports pure subsequent pure modules and forms a coherent part of the students learning. As it is, I feel that the module is some sort of amalgam of interests which puts insufficient focus on the need of the student. 	Feedback will be included on the blackboard page for the module and the students will be informed of this by email within one week of the relevant exam board.

MATH3078	Dr Armando Martino	The grade breakdown were as follows: 29% A, 24% B, 18% C, 29% F.     These are reasonable marks, given that the majority of the F grades were non-attenders. On the whole, the class found the material challenging, but very rewarding.  	Module Overall: 4.4  Lecturer: 4.7    These are very high scores, reflecting in part the popularity of the module and my own comfort with giving it for the fifth time. 	7%	I think that the module, while popular, is overly full and could do with streamlining, as it is a struggle to deliver all the material at a suitable pace. Additionally, there should be much better feed in from MATH3077.     As I will be handing this over next year, and teaching MATH3077, I will coordinate with the new lecturer to try to meet their requirements.

MATH3079	Prof Jacek Brodzki	The exam and the tests were a bit harder this year than previously; despite that the students achieved very good results. 	A main comment in the questionnaires was the turnaround time for returning marked tests; this will be improved for next year. It was good to see that generally the quality of feedback was acceptable. I appreciated the positive comments about the course, but it is clear that there needs to be a better balance between the metric spaces part and topology. However, the assumption is that the students should have achieved a level of proficiency which should make the second part easier to follow. 	9%		Feedback will be included on the blackboard page for the module and the students will be informed of this by email within one week of the relevant exam board.

MATH6002	Prof Christopher Potts, Dr Dung Nguyen	The students’ performance was quite good this year (67.7% on average and with 1 student failed). The students perform really well in the coursework (despite the instructor has already made it reasonably more demanding compared to the previous years). Combining both the exam results and the coursework results, we find a majority of students have achieved the learning outcomes of the module.	Overall, the students provide a good feedback to the module (4.2/5) and to both of the instructors. Students like the practicality of the module. They also like the coursework as it involves solving a real application and with the enhancement on computer programming skills. Some students feel the material covered was overwhelming though.	19%		Feedback will be included on the blackboard page for the module and the students will be informed of this by email within one week of the relevant exam board.	There were no major changes to the module compared to the previous years except for the frequent updates of the lectures slides since the module has been running smoothly. 	We think the module is going on well. We acknowledge that the contents are a bit overwhelming to the students but this is a (single) core module that aims to cover many required areas in deterministic O.R. and mathematical programming and it is quite difficult to cut the contents down.

MATH6004	Dr Athanasios Avramidis, Dr Navid Izady	Two questions of section A, A3 and A4, of the exam were harder than expected, and as a result some fell a few marks short of the required pass mark.

The students seem to have been pleased with the module content and delivery as indicated by an overall rate of 4.5.     Stochastic OR Techniques: A few students have requested more examples. A large number of exercises are already covered both in the lectures and tutorials. See Q12 for meeting the demand of those with weaker background.    Simulation:  Two students found the coursework somewhat too hard, and one would have preferred no group coursework.  There is insufficient evidence about this to warrant changes at this point.  	22%		Feedback will be included on the blackboard page for the module and the students will be informed of this by email within one week of the relevant exam board.	Stochastic OR techniques:      - The number of tutorial questions increased compared to last year.      - A few new concepts were added to each of the topics covered in the course.     - For each of the topics covered, the lectures started by referring to a paper citing an application of the method in practice, using OR Interfaces journal as the main source.  The papers were also posted on Blackboard.     The features above were all liked by the students, and clearly made the course more relevant for application in real world.     Simulation: No changes were made.    	"Stochastic OR Techniques:      A set of easy questions will be set up and posted on Blackboard for students who need further practice before they can start working on tutorial questions.

MATH6005	Miss Marion Penn	The overall marks are quite high, I feel this generally reflects the amount of work that students put into the unit and the understanding that their work demonstrates.    In future years I recommend adding a small (10%) extension into the main coursework to challenge the brightest students.	Overall the student feedback on the module is good.  Some students found the module particularly challenging and would have benefited from some additional support material on the basics.  Comments at the end show a mixture of those who found it hard and those who would have liked to be stretched more, suggesting that overall the pitching is about right.    I added additional questions on lecture recording and peer assessment to the evaluation - the lecture recording went down well and the peer assessment was an improvement on the previous system, but some were less happy than the others.  I will write up separate reports on both of these, including some refinements to the peer marking.	48%	The students had a wide range of prior knowledge, in future I would like to have some additional materials for those with least prior experience of programming.	There was no exam - students have had individual feedback for all assignments and general feedback for the final assignment was posted to blackboard when they were sent their results and individual feedback.	The current syllabus is:<br />No prior programming experience is required.  The module will cover the basic principles of programming in a high level language.<br />  <br />The main focus will, however, be in developing a working facility of Visual Basic.  The module will cover a range of the most commonly used techniques and algorithms, including technical calculations, as well as data manipulation, graphical users interface, file handling, object-oriented programming (OOP), and integration with other packages such as Excel and Access.<br />  <br />Practical exercises are used to reinforce the ideas taught in the module, which will enable the students to build up their own library of algorithms for use in other modules or in project work.    No changes made	Provide podcasts/short recorded lecture segments going into more detail on some aspects of the course/showing coding being done, that students can watch at their own pace to supplement lectures for those with less prior knowledge of programming.    Continue with peer marking exercise with more material to support students in doing it.

MATH6011	Dr Honora Smith	There was a good spread of marks: a good number of distinctions (38% of 45 candidates) and 36% merit. Generally a good approach was made to the coursework. Three people failed, two of whom were late. Six people in total submitted work late, not unusually, though I had hoped that having a Monday hand-in would reduce the number.	An overall mean rating of 4.09 was given, with lecturer rating of 4.36.    Students appreciated the class notes and practical computer sessions, with prompt help given. Responses varied from finding lack of detail to finding that material was covered too quickly, though recognising we'd done our best within time limitations. I agree that there is a lot of material to cover quickly, but that understanding is gained not only in lectures but in the exercises completed afterwards. Material has been reduced over the years as far as possible, but we couldn't remove any of the basics of forecasting.  More lecture time was requested, particularly regarding recognising ARIMA models. On the other hand, more mathematical theory was asked for, which is surprising considering the time spent, particularly on Regression.   	35%	There was a hold-up until teaching restarted, due to annual leave and the new moderation procedure.	No exam. Feedback on the coursework was made available through Gradecenter on Blackboard.	This year students were given the option of using other software for the ARIMA section, because of problems arising previously, but this option was not taken up and problems did not re-appear. Computer worksheets were revised, and changes proved effective in removing unclear areas.	Offer more help with selection of ARIMA models, which seems the main point of difficulty.

MATH6021	Dr Kalliopi Mylona	Not serious problem. The marks for the coursework were quite low compared to last years mark. The main problem was that the reports were not of a very good quality.	The main complaint of the students was that the module lacks of a lab workshop. I believe this is not needed as it is a MSc level course and the students should be able to work by themselves on the statistical package of their choice, as relevant notes are given during the lectures of course. However, perhaps we should consider to add an one hour lab workshop in R and/or SAS.	11%		Feedback will be included on the blackboard page for the module and the students will be informed of this by email within one week of the relevant exam board.

MATH6022	Prof Sujit Sahu	I think the assessment went well as almost all students did very well in this hard theoretical module. This trend should continue but with a slight moderation to ensure that a high proportion of students do not get distinction level marks. Also the marks spreadsheet should have the right classification for MSc students, i.e. pass mark 50, distinction 70 etc. The current version is just same as the one from an undergraduate module.

MATH6027	Prof Steven Gilmour	The results were again very bimodal. This seems to be related to the fact that the final exam is open book and therefore requires the students to understand and apply the methods from the course. Memorisation and regurgitation are nowhere near enough to pass.     I believe that an open book exam is the correct way to assess this course, but the format should change. Currently there are four, more or less equally sized questions, each of which include some basic application and some more advanced applications. This means that student who go wrong on the easy part get essentially zero for that question. This should change to more smaller questions, covering about 60% of the marks, which all students should be able to do. There should then be a couple of more challenging questions to separate the weak students from those who truly understand the material.	Almost no returns. The students are rather skeptical about the worth of these questionnaires.	4%	"The module has been replaced with a new one.     About 1/3 of students just ""don't get it"".

MATH6033	Prof Hazel Inskip, Dr Sarah Crozier	We were happy with the marks resulting from the coursework.  The average was 62%.	The feedback on the module was very positive, with high scores for the organisation of the module (an average of 4.6/5) and the clarity of the lecturers’ speaking (4.7/5)  .  The opportunities for individual help in the tutorial improved from 3.5/5 last year to 4/5 this year.		There are no other comments on this years teaching.	Feedback on the coursework is supplied on the manuscripts that they submitted.	Feedback from students last year indicated that the complex timetabling of the module was unhelpful.  This was sorted out this year, so that the lectures were on a consistent day/time each week; this was a great improvement for the students and the lecturers.    More of the lectures (6 out of 10) were adapted this year to include all the teaching material on the slides.  This meant it was not necessary to provide a handout from Word with verbose paragraphs that were difficult for the students to follow during the lectures – instead they were given handouts of the slides.  This provided a better student experience.  	To date we have used paper submission for the coursework.  However, this has caused problems with lost/missing manuscripts, and means that lecturers' time is taken up with trips to main campus to collect/return coursework.  We will therefore try using an e-submission system next year.    Some administrative issues regarding the coursework will be refined next year:    - We will state the page limit as number of sides, rather than pages, as one student queried this this year.  - Previously we have worded the assignment with the required to ‘write a report… the questions are given to guide you… structure the report using question numbers’.  However, some students have found this wording confusing and aren’t sure how to structure the assignment.  In the future we will simply ask the students to answer to answer the questions.  - We had been using the out-of-date information about the percentages deducted per day late.  We will use the correct information on the assignment next year.  	Module lead	Save and Submit	1569708	Dr Sarah Crozier	1406026629	100	0	0	no	no	yes	yes	yes	yes
MATH6078	Dr Ruben Sanchez Garcia	As this is a 100% problem-based coursework module, students who engaged well, asked for help when needed (classmates and lecturer) and prepared submissions well in advance, did very well. Grading-wise, we can divide the students in two overlapping groups, one with a 60% average (8 students), and one with an 80% average (11 students). In general, I'm quite pleased with the level of engagement (see student questionnaire) and performance of most of the students. 	Fourteen out of 17 students replied to the questionnaire. The feedback was very positive, with good evaluations of both the module and the lecturer. One aspect for improvement was a timely delivery of the coursework, which is something I'll have in mind for next year. One student suggested offering this course in the third year (see Q12 below).	14%	As a lectured course (instead of a reading course as advertised) it is not realistic to cover all the material as per module specification, although it may improved by having separate tutorials (see Q11 below).	I gave oral feedback for each Coursework 1-3 in the tutorial sessions, plus written feedback via Blackboard for Coursework 2-4. In addition, I talked to each student at the tutorial sessions to give brief feedback on individual performances (Coursework 1-3).	I missed out Ruler-and-compass constructions, and Discriminants. This is partly due to four sessions becoming tutorials. Having tutorials was a good idea, as acknowledged by students and shown by their attendance, but next year I'll have fortnightly tutorial sessions booked *in addition* to lecture sessions.	Having specific tutorial sessions (see Q11 above), delivering coursework on time, experimenting with technologies such as zappers, or on-line questionnaires, introducing Ruler-and-compass constructions earlier on.  *THIRD YEAR MODULE* I think this is under discussion (Armando Martino). I support this idea, and so does one student in his/her feedback. 	Module lead	Save and Submit	2086425	Dr Ruben Sanchez Garcia	1402048586	0	100	0	yes	yes	yes	yes	yes	yes
MATH6079	Dr Ashot Minasyan	The assessment showed a variation in the abilities of the students taking the module this year, which seems to be more significant than in the past few years.  As a result of this, it was decided to scale the coursework marks by lowering the C-B borderline. 	Generally, the students seem to have liked the module. Some of the comments complained about the difficulty of the coursework, but I think that it was on a reasonable level. Many of the exercises were the same as in the previous years, but this year the students seemed to struggle more with them. I think that this is due to a weaker cohort of the students taking the module this year.     			There is no exam in this module, but students received copies of their first three marked exercise sheets. 	I introduced a weekly office hour, where the student could come with various question on the module and the coursework. I also distributed the third exercise sheet earlier than originally intended, so that the students could start working on it right after they were finished with the second. Both of these things were requested by the students in the informal feedback.    I also simplified the last exercise sheet to make sure that the level of the problems is appropriate for the (lower) level of some of the students this year.    I think introduction of the office hour was helpful. I am not sure how effective was the early distribution of the third sheet.	Some of the things that could be addressed next year include:  1) it would be worth setting up an office hour from the start of the semester  and   2) if the first student meeting is before the first lecture, then it should either be cancelled or the students should be told what they are expected to do.

MATH6108	Prof Ian Leary	As in the previous year that I taught this module, the coursework scores were considerably higher than the exam scores, but the combination gave what I considered to be a good record of the students' abilities without having to apply any scaling.  (I scaled very slightly in the end, but that was because four students who fell just below two borderlines demonstrated a performance consistent with the higher grade.)      I was extremely busy with REF stuff while teaching this module, and so I was given some teaching assistance: a postgraduate student marked the courseworks for me.  This did save me some time, but I feel that overall it did not work very well.  The PGR student's marking was consistent with mine (unsurprising since I gave him a detailed marking scheme).  However, I still needed to know exactly what the students had done in the courseworks, both for pedagogical reasons and to deal with the (albeit few) student complaints about the marking.  Next time that I teach the course, I will mark all the courseworks myself again.      	I was pleased that in general the students liked the feedback on the courseworks, and felt that the level of the module was appropriate.  I was also pleased that the students appreciated the printed notes.  I was chastened to learn that a small number of students described the lectures as `unplanned', and that some students did not appreciate the way that I would attack worked examples `live'.  In view of these comments, I will make an effort to rehearse any example calculations in detail before lectures.    	12%	No further comment.    	Feedback will be included on the blackboard page for the module and the students will be informed of this by email within one week of the relevant exam board.

I recommend the lecturer to consider paring down some of the more technical sections of the notes; proofs that are clearly too long to be examinable (such as the discussion of which Moebius transformations correspond to rotations and the material on Clifford algebras) might in some cases be profitably omitted from the lectures.      In response to student comments, I recommend the lecturer to schedule the final coursework hand-in a bit earlier (say week 10) so that this coursework does not interfere with revision.

MATH6109	Prof Carsten Gundlach	The coursework was formative, and hard, as intended, and this year the exam was relatively easy, also as intended. Bookwork questions are unpopular and the students did not do well in them, but I think they are appropriate when marked generously. 	Comments are less good than last year, which surprises me given the high attendance rate and good atmosphere in the class. Note that only 10 of 28 students replied to the questionnaire.     By changing the syllabus, I think I made the module more interesting. I made a number of changes that should be welcome: a weekly office hour, full printed notes, typed model answers to homework (I had a homework question after most lectures, as in previous years), typed model answers to coursework, a typed revision guide. 	10%	I forgot to update the module profile to reflect the new syllabus. This needs to be done for next year. 	Exam feedback was given on blackboard and announced by email. 	After extensive consultation with colleagues, and with last year's students, this year I dropped the classical theory of curves and surfaces, and instead added a section on hypersurfaces of Riemannian manifolds (which therefore generalises the classical theory of surfaces). I think this allowed a more consistent presentation throughout the module. However, it removed a number of stock calculations from the exam and coursework, and so the coursework was more challenging. 	I plan to put the new material on hypersurfaces at the end, or may drop it altogether. 	Module lead	Save and Submit	1550519	Prof Carsten Gundlach	1393334175	80	20	0	yes	yes	yes	yes	yes	yes

It may be that the quality of the intake has been improved.	Students always find this module challenging, especially given that they have had less than one year to adapt to the style of the examinations.  The syllabus is dictated by the need to meet the IFoA external accreditation.      The overall module score this year was lower than previous years.  This was the first year that the module had split teaching.  This may have affected the student experience.  The decision to teach jointly is a matter for AU Group heads, not the course lecturers.  The scores relating to the lecturers were significantly higher (>4.3) than the marks given to the course.    There is a low response rate for the module questionnaire, despite repeated reminders in class to complete the form.	10%		Feedback will be included on the blackboard page for the module and the students will be informed of this by email within one week of the relevant exam board.

The other reason of low average is that there are couple of students who had extremely low marks [between 0 and 9].	The students were very satisfied with the module and rated the module highly. The overall performance was satisfactory and the evaluation results show a clear improvement compared to the last year. Students really liked the red book which contains problem sets, past exam papers and class tests with solutions. 	12%		Feedback is included on the blackboard page for the module and the students were informed of this by email.	We followed the same syllabus as the last year. The lecture notes were uploaded on the blackboard weekly which was appreciated by the students. Since they liked the red book last year, we updated it this year and distributed on the first day of the term. 	Students asked to reduce the number of questions in the final exam. This is also suggested by the external examiners. Therefore we are going to reduce the exam time from 3 hours to 2 hours.

MATH6131	Prof James Vickers	There was a problem with class test one. The coursework was therefore scaled to give an average of 60%. The exam was also scaled to bring the pass/fail borderline and B/C borderline to the appropriate point. 	The original lecturer for this module Dr Oertel was a lecturer who was new to Southampton and had not taught this material before and obtained a very poor overall evaluation. There are many negative comments from the students relating to the first half of the module.     We became aware of the problems with the lecturer about halfway through the module and the last third was taught by Dr Kennedy. He obtained an excellent rating from the students obtaining a score of over 4.5. Overall the module scored an average of 2.8 which is significantly lower than in prewvious years. it was clear ffom the written comments that this was largely due to the problems at the start of the module where there were problems with the material covered by the lecturer and the style of the lectures. There were some positive comments about the new set book. 	14%	As explained above the initial lecturer deviated to some extent from the module specification - spending time on some aspects that were not central to the module. This was corrected by Dr Kennedy and the students performed well on quite a testing exam (which was set by Professor Vickers who had taught the module the previous year). 	Feedback has been  included on the blackboard page for the module and the students have been informed of this by email.  	The current syllabus is effectively set by the requirements that it satisfy the exemption requirements of the FIA.  The current syllabus is:<br /><ul>  <li>Simple and compound interest. Time value of money.  Rate of interest, rate of discount, and force of interest.  Accumulated values and discounted values.  Accumulation and discounting of a (possibly infinite) cash flow to a given time, where both the rate of cash flow and the force of interest may be time-varying.</li>  <li>Relationships between rates of interest and discount over different time periods.  Nominal rates, effective rates, rates payable p times per annum.</li>  <li>Definition of the standard compound interest functions and relationships between them.</li>  <li>Generalised cash flow modelling.  Equation of value for a cash flow problem, and methods of solution.</li>  <li>Loans.  Equation of value corresponding to periodic repayment of a loan.  Interest and capital content of annuity payments where the annuity is used to repay a loan.</li>  <li>Net present value (NPV), accumulated profit, and internal rate of return (IRR) for investment projects. </li>  <li>Investment project appraisal using NPV and IRR. Real rate of return in presence of inflation.</li>  <li>Measurement of investment performance</li>  <li>Consumer credit transactions and calculations.  Annual percentage rate of charge (APR).</li>  <li>Ordinary shares. Constant dividend growth model of share valuation. Fixed-interest securities.  Present value and redemption yield for a fixed-interest security, including effects of taxation.</li>  <li>Yield curves and the term structure of interest rates.</li>  <li>Investment and risk characteristics of standard asset classes (Government fixed-interest securities, other fixed-interest securities, equities, etc.) available for investment purposes.</li>  <li>Discounted mean term, volatility, convexity. Matching of assets and liabilities, immunization.</li>  <li>Simple stochastic interest rate models. Mean, variance, and distribution function for the accumulated amount of an initial investment, and applications.</li>  <li>Forward interest rates.  Forward contracts.  The concept of no-arbitrage pricing and its use in determining the fair value of a forward contract.</li>  </ul>  	The main enhancement will be to revert to the use of an experienced Southampton lecturer for the whole of the module. However the use of the new textbook for this year will be continued as it covers the syllabus of the module and recieved positive comments from the students.

MATH6135	Dr Stefanie Biedermann, Prof Dankmar Boehning	The students engaged very well with the module, and obtained excellent results.	The feedback from questionnaires was mostly very positive. We will make a few minor changes following the students' suggestions, e.g. more examples in the Optimal Design part.	9%		Feedback will be included on the blackboard page for the module and the students will be informed of this by email within one week of the relevant exam board.	This module has been taught for the first time.	This module is available to both MMATH and Statistics MSc students, i.e. students from different backgrounds. We will put even more effort into striking the right balance between theoretical and applied material for both groups.

MATH6137	Dr Stephen Theriault	The assessment data is generally positive. The students seemed to be happy with the lectures and the course overall.     Comments included a request for more time on exact sequences, which matches my own thoughts (see item 12 below), and a request for more examples (again, see item 12 for a fuller picture). 	There were 4 students in the course, of a generally stronger calibre. The end course marks were 3 firsts (including a very strong first) and one lower second. 	4%	"In giving the course for the first time this year, I found the natural path to follow touched deeply on some topics in the module specification, while touching lightly on others (and there were other topics labelled ""if time permits"" in the module specification which were not touched upon at all).     However, the module specification was designed to allow flexibility, given the possibility of different lecturers over time having different objectives within the larger framework of Homotopy Theory and Homology. I would therefore not recommend a change to the module specification. "	Feedback will be included on the blackboard page for the module and the students will be informed of this by email within one week of the relevant exam board.	This was the first year the module ran. 	Upon reflection, perhaps less time should be spent at the beginning of the course on proving the exponential law (which is a big effort), replacing it instead with a summary of the ideas in the proof. It's these ideas and the application of the law that are most important.     The time saved would be used to review and enhance material on exact sequences, which play a pivotal part later in the course, but which the students found hard going, even though they were among the better students in the current MMath year.     This would also have the additional effect of producing more examples and exercise sheet style questions early on in the course. As it was, it took 4 weeks or so to build up enough material to start asking reasonable questions, and the students got a bit edgy with the wait. I think this is the source of the questionnaire comment (and similar informal feedback) requesting more examples.

MATH6138	Prof Peter Kropholler	no comments.	From the quick feedback it was clear that students would have appreciated more exercises during the course. [This course is 80% assessed by final examination.] This is something that can be arranged for future years.	5%	This was the first run for this course and from this it is clear that there are many ways in which the course will develop over the next year or so. 	Feedback will be included on the blackboard page for the module and the students will be informed of this by email within one week of the relevant exam board.	The current syllabus is:<br />	The notes for this course are under revision. The main goal is to add a selection of advanced topics, all of which are mentioned in the current syllabus but which can be treated with caution. The initial lectures can also be improved by including a more metric and less combinatorial / topolgical description of some of the basic material.

MATH6139	Dr Marika Taylor	No.	Students were happy with this module. One student requested more lemmas and theorems in the notes but these are not appropriate for a module which is focussed on theoretical physics. Next year I will explain this to students whose background is pure mathematics. 	6%	Coursework was marked within a week and feedback was given individually to all students.     Although this module is timetabled as two hours per week I also spent one office hour per week with the students, as a tutorial hour to help them with assignments. 	Feedback will be included on the blackboard page for the module and the students will be informed of this by email within one week of the relevant exam board.	This is a new module and all notes, example sets, courseworks and exams were prepared from scratch. The syllabus taught is in agreement with that given in the module description.	Students were more familiar with differential geometry than expected, so less time will be spent on mathematical preliminaries.

MATH6140	Dr Benjamin Macarthur, Dr Ruben Sanchez Garcia, Dr Konstantinos Zygalakis	In order to encourage independent learning students were assessed on three short reports. With the help of the lecturers input they were encouraged to identify an appropriate area for research for each of the reports. Once an appropriate topic was chosen they then researched their chosen area and prepared their reports with some guidance. Overall the students engaged well with this process and generally produced reports of good quality. 	In total 10/14 students answered the questionnaire. The overall evaluation average was 4.0, while all the lecturers were given an average mark of >4.0    The students found the course a bit harder than other modules (average 4.0) but this was to be expected since the material discussed was quite advanced. One more issue that was raised was related to the amount of coursework, so we may have to think about how to deal with this next year. Feedback was positively commented on. Most students praised the freedom of choice for the written assessments and deemed the module as very interesting. On the other hand, there were issues about the integration of the three parts.    	9%	We may need to work on the integration of the three parts. 	We sent individual qualitative feedback to each student for each project.	No changes made. This is the first year that the course has run.	Next time, we will run the course on the same basis as this year. Some modifications to the content, in response to our own assessment of the course and student feedback, will be made. In particular, we'll make sure that the three parts of the module are better integrated, and try to reduce the workload by encouraging shorter projects (i.e. by indicating a page length/limit).
